## 📋 Executive Overview

**Viora Bills** is an enterprise-grade, web-based invoicing, GST billing, payment tracking, and sales analytics platform. Engineered specifically to comply with Indian GST rules and modern financial accounting principles, it provides a complete end-to-end workflow from customer onboarding and item cataloging to automated sequential invoice issuance, live A4 PDF generation, ACID transactional payment reconciliation, and real-time sales reporting.

### 🌟 Key Feature Matrix (Phases 1–5)

| Functional Domain | Implemented Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Customer Management** | Full CRUD, phone/email/GSTIN search, live state detection, unreferenced customer deletion, and soft-delete archiving (`isArchived: true`) for customers with historical invoices. |
| **Product & Service Catalog** | Full CRUD, multi-unit tracking (`PCS`, `HRS`, `MTR`, `KG`, `BOX`, `SET`), custom GST rates (0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28%), price precision, unreferenced deletion, and soft-delete archiving. |
| **GST Calculation Engine** | Decimal-safe arithmetic (via `decimal.js`), line-item discounts applied prior to tax, automatic Intra-State (50% CGST + 50% SGST) vs. Inter-State (100% IGST) tax determination, and banker's half-up paisa rounding (`ROUND_HALF_UP`). |
| **Invoice Lifecycle** | Two-tier lifecycle: editable `DRAFT` status and immutable `ISSUED` status. Sequential numbering (`INV-YYYY-XXXXXX`) assigned atomically upon issuance. |
| **Snapshot Audit Integrity** | Customer information, GSTIN, business profile, item descriptions, and unit prices are permanently snapshotted at the moment of invoice issuance, guaranteeing that future catalog or client changes never corrupt historical financial statements. |
| **PDF Generation & Printing** | On-the-fly streaming PDF generation using `PDFKit` with clean corporate branding, GST tax breakdown tables, and payment status badges. Includes dedicated CSS `@media print` rules for flawless physical A4 printing. |
| **Payment Ledger & Concurrency** | ACID transaction payment recording with row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), idempotency key deduplication (`requestKey`), overpayment rejection, and real-time status transitions (`UNPAID` ➔ `PARTIALLY_PAID` ➔ `PAID`). |
| **Executive Dashboard** | Real-time metrics grid displaying Total Sales, Total Invoices, Payments Collected, and Outstanding Receivables. Strict exclusion of draft invoices from revenue figures. Filterable by customizable date ranges. |
| **Sales & Collection Analytics** | Dual-perspective reporting: **Sales** attributed by invoice issuance date vs. **Collections** attributed by payment settlement date. Comparative timeline chart with Day and Month grouping. |
| **Security & Reliability** | Multi-origin CORS support, production error masking (no stack trace leakage), database parameterization, input sanitization via Zod, and system health monitoring (`/api/health`). |

## 🗄️ Database Architecture & Entity Relationships

The relational model is designed using PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM. Financial figures (`unitPrice`, `taxRate`, `discountAmount`, `taxableAmount`, `cgstAmount`, `sgstAmount`, `igstAmount`, `lineTotal`, `grandTotal`, `amount`) are stored as high-precision `Decimal(12, 2)` types to avoid binary floating-point drift.

## 🔒 Security & Data Integrity Audit

### 1. Prototype Scope & Access Limitations
> [!WARNING]
> **Authentication & Authorization Scope Disclosure**:
> The current system is an engineering prototype designed for single-business operations. It deliberately does not include multi-user login, role-based access control (RBAC), or session tokens.
> 
> **Deployment Recommendation**:
> Until user authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0 / JWT / NextAuth) is integrated, **do not expose this service to the public Internet without perimeter protection**. In production staging, restrict access via a VPN, IP allowlist, or reverse-proxy basic authentication.

### 2. Implemented Security Controls
1. **Secrets & Git Sanitization**:
   - Zero hardcoded API keys or database passwords exist in source files.
   - All real environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`), database files (`.db_data/`), and build artifacts are strictly ignored via root `.gitignore`.
   - Tracked templates (`.env.example`) contain only sanitized placeholder values.
2. **Production Error Masking**:
   - `errorHandler.ts` detects `NODE_ENV === 'production'`.
   - Unhandled 500 server errors return a generic message: `"An unexpected internal server error occurred"`.
   - Stack traces and raw database driver exceptions are completely suppressed in production client responses.
3. **CORS Hardening**:
   - `app.ts` dynamically parses single or comma-separated allowed origins from `CLIENT_URL`.
   - Normalizes trailing slashes to prevent cross-origin mismatches between hosting providers.
4. **SQL Injection Prevention**:
   - All database reads and writes execute via Prisma ORM parameterized queries.
   - Raw queries (`$queryRaw`) strictly use parameterized tagged template literals (`Prisma.sql`), preventing SQL injection attacks.
5. **Idempotency & Race Condition Defense**:
   - All payments require a unique `requestKey`. Re-submitting the same key returns `HTTP 409 ERR_DUPLICATE_PAYMENT_REQUEST`, guaranteeing no double-charges occur on network retries.
   - Concurrent payment allocations utilize PostgreSQL row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), serializing balance calculations and preventing overpayments under heavy parallel load.
6. **Financial Precision Integrity**:
   - Strict decimal arithmetic avoids IEEE-754 floating point imprecision (e.g., `0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004`).
   - All currency values are rounded using the `ROUND_HALF_UP` algorithm to the nearest paisa.
